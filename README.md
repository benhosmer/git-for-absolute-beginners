# Git for the Absolute Beginner (Interactive)

This will be an interactive webinar where you'll be able to follow along and actually use git. You don't need any prior experience with version control, nor do you need any coding experience either. You'll learn the following:

1. How git works.
2. How to tell git to what to track.
3. How to tell git you really mean it.
4. How to clone a repository and what that actually means.
4. How to share your changes with others.
5. How to interact with github.
6. How to get changes that others have introduced to a central repository.
7. How to create a branch to isolate your work.
8. The benefits of public/private key authentication.
9. Resources for taking your learning further.
10. The importance of a .gitignore file.
11. The importance of descriptive commit comments.

To prepare for this, you should:

1. [Install](http://git-scm.com/download) git for your operating system of choice.
2. Set up a [github](https://github.com/join) account. (We'll use this to work on a sample project.

We'll use a [demonstration](https://github.com/benhosmer/git-for-absolute-beginners) that we all can interact with during the webinar.
